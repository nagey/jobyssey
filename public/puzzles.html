	<h2>Kleptopia</h2>
	<p>Jan and Maria have fallen in love (via the internet) and Jan wishes to mail her a ring. Unfortunately, they live in the country of Kleptopia where anything sent through the mail will be stolen unless it is enclosed in a padlocked box. </p>

	<p>Jan and Maria each have plenty of padlocks, but none to which the other has a key. How can Jan get the ring safely into Maria’s hands?</p>
</div>
<div id ="1" style="display:none">
		<div class="answer">
	<p>Jan sends Maria a box with the ring in it and one of his padlocks on it. Upon receipt Maria affixes her own padlock to box and mails it back with both padlocks on it. When Jan gets it he removes his padlock and sends the box back to Maria; voila! This solution is not just play; the idea is fundamental in Diffie-Hellman key exchange, a historic breakthrough in cryptography.</p>

	<h2>Pirates</h2>
	<p>Five pirates have 100 gold coins and have to divide up the loot. The pirates are all perfectly logical and perfectly selfish.</p>
	<p>The captain always proposes a distribution of the loot. All pirates vote on the proposal, and if half the crew or more go "Aye", the loot is divided as proposed.  If the captain fails to obtain support of at least half his crew (which includes himself), the other pirates will make him walk the plank, and start over again with the next most senior pirate as captain.</p>
	<p>What is the maximum number of coins the captain can keep without risking his life?</p>
</div>
<div id ="2" style="display:none">
	<div class="answer">
	<h3>Answer: 98</h3>
	<p>The captain says he will take 98 coins, and will give one coin to the third most senior pirate and another coin to the most junior pirate. He then explains his decision in a manner like this...</p>
	<p>If there were 2 pirates, pirate 2 being the most senior, he would just vote for himself and that would be 50% of the vote, so he's obviously going to keep all the money for himself.</p>
	<p>If there were 3 pirates, pirate 3 has to convince at least one other person to join in his plan. Pirate 3 would take 99 gold coins and give 1 coin to pirate 1. Pirate 1 knows if he does not vote for pirate 3, then he gets nothing, so obviously is going to vote for this plan.</p>
	<p>If there were 4 pirates, pirate 4 would give 1 coin to pirate 2, and pirate 2 knows if he does not vote for pirate 4, then he gets nothing, so obviously is going to vote for this plan.</p>
	<p>As there are 5 pirates, pirates 1 & 3 had obviously better vote for the captain, or they face choosing nothing or risking death.</p>

	<h2>Princes</h2>
	<p>A king wants his daughter to marry the smartest of 3 extremely intelligent young princes.  The princes are gathered into a room and seated, facing one another, and are shown 2 black hats and 3 white hats. They are blindfolded, and 1 hat is placed on each of their heads, with the remaining hats are hidden in a different room.</p>
	<p>The king tells them that the first prince to deduce the color of his hat without looking at it will marry his daughter; a wrong guess means death. You are one of the princes. You see 2 white hats on the other prince's heads. After some time you realize that the other princes are unable to deduce the color of their hat, or are unwilling to guess. What color is your hat?</p>
</div>
<div id ="3" style="display:none">
	<div class="answer">
	<h3>Answer: White.</h3>
	<p>The king would not select two white hats and one black hat. This would mean two princes would see one black hat and one white hat. You would be at a disadvantage if you were the only prince wearing a black hat.</p>
	<p>If you were wearing the black hat, it would not take long for one of the other princes to deduce he was wearing a white hat.</p>
	<p>If an intelligent prince saw a white hat and a black hat, he would eventually realize that the king would never select two black hats and one white hat. Any prince seeing two black hats would instantly know he was wearing a white hat. Therefore if a prince can see one black hat, he can work out he is wearing white.</p>
	<p>Therefore the only fair test is for all three princes to be wearing white hats. After waiting some time just to be sure, you can safely assert you are wearing a white hat.</p>
