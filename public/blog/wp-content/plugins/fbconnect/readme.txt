== Description ==
Allow the use of Facebook Connect API for Wordpress authentication/registration of users and send comments to Facebook feed.

1. Access the blog (login) with your Facebook credentials where facebook validates the username without asking for the password necessary to access the blog/website.

2. The user does not need to register in the blog because thanks to the plugin the user can utilize his complete profile information he already edited in Facebook. 
This is tremendously useful as the user does not have to register and create profiles over and over again!

One way of promoting the site using the so powerful and marvellous word-of-mouth.
