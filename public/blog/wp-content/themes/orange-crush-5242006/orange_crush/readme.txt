	unzipped this theme for Wordpress.  Yay for you!  This 
	package should contain the following file structure...

	I'll send you a non-corrupt version:

2)  	There are a few other things you will need, which are

	- Download "Show/Hide" plugin from Scripty Goddess:
        http://www.scriptygoddess.com/archives/2004/05/20/show-hide-more-with-wordpress/
	  Download and install this plugin to enable the "show/hide" 
	  option for extended entries.  It's simple enough to do - 
	  just visit the above site and download the file.  
	  Installation instructions are located on the site, and
	  within the zipped file you get.

	- Download "Widgets" from Automattic:
	http://automattic.com/code/widgets/
	  Download and install the "widgets" plugin, to make
	  sidebar customization easier for you.  Again, 
	  installation instructions are included with the package.
	  THIS DOWNLOAD IS OPTIONAL - if you don't wanna use
	  widgets, you don't have to.  This theme is set up to 
	  its thing either way :)

	- Download "Sideblog" asides plugin:
	http://katesgasis.com/2005/10/24/sideblog/
	  THIS DOWNLOAD IS OPTIONAL.  But if you'd like to have
	  asides in your blog, then this is the plugin to use.


I'm going to assume that you've already got Wordpress installed 
and running just fine on your server.  I will not assume you know 
much more than that - I'd like to make this file as easy to 
understand as possible so that users who are new to this can 
figure everything out without too much hardship.

So now we begin the actual instructions...

3)	FTP (or login - however you usually connect to upload files) 
	into your server.  Surf your way into the "wp-content/themes" 
	folder.  Create a new folder in your "themes" area, 
	called "orange_crush".  Copy all files - retaining the 
	file structure - into this newly created folder.

4) 	If you haven't installed the above-listed plugins, be 
	sure to do so now by uploading them into your 
	"wp-content/plugins" folder.

5)	Open up your browser window and get into your Wordpress 
	administration area (where you go to create posts!).  
	If you have not already installed the plugins, select 
	the "Plugins" tab, and "Activate" the ones you've chosen 
	to use.  Then select the "Presentation" tab from the menu, 
	and you should see the "Orange Crush" theme right there 
	as an option to choose from.  Click it!

6) 	You should now notice a new thing: at the top, usually 
	where "Themes" and "Theme Editor" reside, you should 
	now also see "Sidebar Widgets" (if you chose to install 
	the widgets plugin) and "Orange Crush Options".  As of 
	right now, the "Options" area is simply set to allow you 
	to turn on notifications of updates to this theme, and 
	to change the theme color from "Orange" to "Blue".

That's pretty much it!  You'll need to set up your plugins - if 
you decided to use them - but for the most part, you're done and 
ready to use the theme to your heart's content.


NOW --

That all being said - here's the favor I ask of you, dear user.  
This is my very first attempt at creating a WordPress Theme.  
I know there will be issues and errors that I am simply not aware 
of, and that will come to light when people actually start 
using it.

All I ask is that if you come to an issue - no matter how 
minor - please notify me.  This was a fun project for me to 
play with, and I'd like to continue.  To continue, I feel I 
must strive to become very good at it and be able to forsee 
problems before they become one.  If you can simply contact me 
with *any* issues you come across, it would help me to better 
this theme and any others I create.  By doing this, you are not 
only helping me (and helping develop my WordPress skills)
but you are helping yourself and the WordPress community in 
the end.

So please, any issues at all, contact me at my website:
