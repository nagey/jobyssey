           WordPress Theme: Orange Crush v.1.262007

-------------------- what's been changed? -------------------

1/26/2007 

- Release of WP 2.1 forced a few updates. Sidebar links and
  archives are no longer using deprecated tags.  This means
  that, to use this theme, you need to be using WP 2.1.  So, 
  go upgrade!

- Made the popup comments more optional, and they are no 
  longer the default.  Popup comments can be used - all of
  the information is still there, but now it's disabled by
  default, per mass requests.

- Edited the theme to clean up CSS and to make changes/fixes 
  for various browsers.

1/16/2007 

- changed the footer to allow for more ease in adding actual 
  footer content (had a lot of complaints about that!)

- removed the actual URL from the header (turns out a spammer 
  bought the original URL I had in there for example-showing 
  purposes.  Learned my lesson there!)

- removed the *visible* header form the footer and returned 
  it to the beginning.  This had originally been done for 
  source-ordering purposes (to aid in SEO), but the general 
  consensus is that no one liked it.  So begone, 
  header-in-the-footer code!

- removed the "js" directory - turned out it was just taking 
  up unecessary space.

                             READ ME!

1)  	If you're reading this, you've already downloaded and 
	unzipped this theme for Wordpress.  Yay for you!  This 
	package should contain the following file structure...
	if it does not, please contact me at the above URL, and 
	I'll send you a non-corrupt version:

	IMAGES
	These are the necessary images for this theme.

	 - header_red.gif
	 - header_black.gif
	 - quote_left.gif

	 - scroll.gif
	 - scroll_small.gif
	 - search.gif
	 - search_blue.gif
	 - search_green.gif
	 - search_red.gif
	 - search_black.gif
	 - wave_bg.gif
	 - wave_bg_blue.gif
	 - wave_bg_green.gif
	 - wave_bg_red.gif
	 - wave_bg_black.gif

	SCRIPTS
	These are the javascripts necessary to make certain parts 
	of the website function properly.  A breif description of 
	what each of these scripts do are located in the 
	header.php file.
	 - blur.js
	 - external.js
	 - showhide.js

	STYLES
	This is the folder which contains the alternate stylesheet
	for the site.  You may use these as a template to create 
	your own alternate versions of the site.
	 - COMMENTS
	    - comments_blue_style.css
	    - comments_green_style.css
	    - comments_red_style.css
	    - comments_black_style.css
	 - blue_style.css
	 - green_style.css
	 - red_style.css
	 - black_style.css

	ROOT/ORANGE_CRUSH
	These are the files located in the root folder.
	- 404.php
	- archive.php
	- archives.php
	- comments.css
	- comments.php
	- comments-popup.php
	- footer.php
	- functions.php
	- header.php
	- index.php
	- links.php
	- page.php
	- readme.txt (and you are!)
	- screenshot.png
	- search.php
	- searchform.php
	- sidebar.php
	- single.php
	- style.css
	- version.php


2)	FTP (or login - however you usually connect to upload files) 
	into your server.  Surf your way into the "wp-content/themes" 
	folder.  Create a new folder in your "themes" area, 
	called "orange_crush".  Copy all files - retaining the 
	file structure - into this newly created folder.

3) 	If you haven't installed the above-listed plugins, be 
	sure to do so now by uploading them into your 
	"wp-content/plugins" folder.

4)	Open up your browser window and get into your Wordpress 
	administration area (where you go to create posts!).  
	If you have not already installed the plugins, select 
	the "Plugins" tab, and "Activate" the ones you've chosen 
	to use.  Then select the "Presentation" tab from the menu, 
	and you should see the "Orange Crush" theme right there 
	as an option to choose from.  Click it!

5) 	You should now notice a new thing: at the top, usually 
	where "Themes" and "Theme Editor" reside, you should 
	now also see "Sidebar Widgets" (if you chose to install 
	the widgets plugin) and "Orange Crush Options".  As of 
	right now, the "Options" area is simply set to allow you 
	to turn on notifications of updates to this theme, and 
	to change the theme color from "Orange" to "Blue".

That's pretty much it!  You'll need to set up your plugins - if 
you decided to use them - but for the most part, you're done and 
ready to use the theme to your heart's content.

6)      For the record (since it has been asked about in the past),
	this theme is free for any tyoe of use.  If you need a license
	to read, this theme falls under the GNU Public License - 
	which basically says you can use it for whatever you like
	to your heart's content, but if you try to claim any part
	of these files as your own, or if you try to sell any
	of the files (or the template as a whole) to someone without
	my permission, you'll be in a whole world of trouble when 
	my lawyers get hold of you.  But, other than that, it's a
	free-for-all.  Use it on business sites, personal - whatever.
	Enjoy.


NOW --

That all being said - here's the favor I ask of you, dear user.  
This is my very first attempt at creating a WordPress Theme.  
I know there will be issues and errors that I am simply not aware 
of, and that will come to light when people actually start 
using it.

All I ask is that if you come to an issue - no matter how 
minor - please notify me.  This was a fun project for me to 
play with, and I'd like to continue.  To continue, I feel I 
must strive to become very good at it and be able to forsee 
problems before they become one.  If you can simply contact me 
with *any* issues you come across, it would help me to better 
this theme and any others I create.  By doing this, you are not 
only helping me (and helping develop my WordPress skills)
but you are helping yourself and the WordPress community in 
the end.

So please, any issues at all, contact me at my website:

Thank you!
