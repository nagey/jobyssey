		<h1>Someone just came into my office and handed in their notice, and refilling this position is a top priority.  How can I fast-track my search?</h1>
		<ol>
		<li>If it's an amicable departure and the departing employee did a good job, ask them to sit down with you for 5 minutes and answer these questions as concisely as possible</li>
		<ul>
		   <li>What 5 tasks take up most of your time in order of importance?</li>
		   <li>What skills are a must have for this job?  Is there anything else thats a plus but not essential?</li>
		   <li>What kind of personality suits this job? </li>
		   <li>What is the coolest thing about this job?</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Have the hiring manager or a senior colleague have a look at these answers, and add anything they think is key.</li>
		<li>Use these answers to add a new job on Jobyssey.  Stymied by the 3 questions?  Try hitting refresh, and if the next set don't look any better, get the hiring manager or leaving employee on the phone.  If you can't answer these questions you'll need to know a little more to decide about candidates. </li>
		<li>Look through the search results quickly, and walk the 5 best or so over to the hiring manager (who will be blown away that you have a portfolio of candidates ready within an hour).  Ask them to have a look and give you a yes/ no for interview while you're there- try to get 2-4 OKed for interview.  If there aren't at least 2 that are suitable, book in a meeting the same day with the hiring manager to look through candidates together on Jobyssey to help clarify what they need.</li>
		<li>Email your prospective candidates.  Propose specific interview times within the next 5 business days, and request that they reply within 48 hours. </li>
		<li>With any luck, you should have some interviews booked in by the next morning.  As you get applications, try to have an up or down decision on arranging an interview the same day you get the application to ensure the role gets filled as quickly as possible.</li>
		</ol>
