		<h1>How many skills should I add and how should I decide what to add?</h1>
		<p>For most roles, 6-10 skills is a good number.  You should include everything that is a must.  If it's a difficult to fill position, you may want to leave off some of the "nice to have" skills to get a broader range of candidates; on the other hand, if there are likely to be many applicants, add on several optional skills to help differentiate applicants.  Less than 4-6 skills can give the job description an appearance of being hastily done, so if there are only a few required skills it's key to add detail about the role in the job description.  On the other hand, more than 10 skills can make it harder for candidates to focus in on the most important, or can deter applicants. </p>
		<p>Talk with the person who knows the most about the role to decide what skills to add.  It's important to include anything that may not be one of the primary duties but is still necessary to get the job done.</p>
