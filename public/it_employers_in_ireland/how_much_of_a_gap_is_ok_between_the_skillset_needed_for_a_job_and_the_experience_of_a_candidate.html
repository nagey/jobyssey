		<h1>How much of a gap is ok between the skillset needed for a job and the experience of a candidate?</h1>
		<p>It depends on a number of factors, including the level of support, training, resources and backup available, similarity to other skills they may have, and how pressurized the office environment and task are.  In general, it is good to have some learning gap between the current role your prospective employee is in and the one you're hiring them for, to keep things engaging for them.  It's good to be sure, though, that the amount of new skills to be learned are manageable, and that there are others on the team with some skill overlap, both to provide some cover during the transition process and to answer questions as needed.  </p>
