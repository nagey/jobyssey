		<h1>Can I see a sample job spec (or sample job posting)?</h1>
		<p>Sure!  If Jobyssey were hiring another developer right now, here’s what our job description would look like:</p>

		<h2>Ruby on Rails developer </h2>
		<p>Jobyssey is a unique web app for skills based job searching.  Due to continuing expansion, we’re looking to add another developer to our small team to continue bolting on new functionality (like skills certification tests).</p>

		<h3>About the job:</h3>
		<ul class="needsbullets"> 
		<li>60+% of your time will be spent developing new functionality, with another 30% on refactoring existing features, integrating gem updates, etc., with about 10% troubleshooting or front end work thrown in.  </li>
		<li>As a small company, we’ll welcome your involvement at every step of the software development process (decisions about features to add to releases, architecture, lots and lots of coding, testing, and some design) and give you ownership of various projects.  </li>
		<li>For the most part, you’ll be focusing on writing back-end code for the application, but once in a while we’ll ask you to do some HTML/CSS work, or possibly even write content, add to the company blog, or help a client with a thorny technical query.  </li>
		<li>To be successful in this job, you need to have a zeal for doing things “the right way” (even when no one’s looking), be comfortable with troubleshooting on your own, and eat, sleep and breathe software development- if you spend your weekends coding your own pet projects, we want to talk to you.  </li>
		</ul>
		<h3>About you:</h3>
		<ul class="needsbullets"> 
		<li>1-2 years professional work experience with good references- demonstrated ability to take responsibility for own work with minimal oversight. </li>
		<li>Solid application development experience in RoR with a wide feature set (similar level of complexity to Jobyssey), and a good awareness of Rails overall (experience installing and using a variety of gems, working with server-side issues, etc.). </li>
		<li>Broad web development experience- we’re a start up where everyone wears lots of hats, so in addition to Ruby you should have a good working command of HTML/CSS, Photoshop, testing/QA, SEO, and so on. </li>
		</ul>
