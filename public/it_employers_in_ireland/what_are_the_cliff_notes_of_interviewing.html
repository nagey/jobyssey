		<h1>I've never interviewed someone before.  What are the Cliff Notes of interviewing?</h1>
			<ol>
		   <li>Read their CV over again before they arrive.  Mark anything you want to ask about.</li>
		   <li>Welcome them, take a minute or two to ask about their trip over so they feel relaxed.</li>
		   <li>Tell them how the interview is going to go- discussing their background, some questions from you about their skills, a quick overview of the company and open position, and time for their questions. </li>
		   <li>Ask them to tell you about their background, letting them know you may jump in with questions.  After they've summed it up, ask your specific questions about their experience.</li>
		   <li>Ask them about their skills.  It's OK to ask general knowledge questions about the skills needed, but don't play Trivial Pursuit with them about minutia.  Ask them to explain how they would solve a hypothetical problem.  If they are a developer, ask them to write out some code for you on the whiteboard or a sheet of paper.  Look for how they think about things, not specific pieces of information or silly goofs.  You might also want to talk through a hypothetical problem with them.  Keep in mind, though, to keep a pleasant demeanor and nudge them in the right direction if they freeze and can’t figure out where to start (don’t channel your scariest school teacher). </li> 
		   <li>Tell them about your company and about this job.  Even if you're pretty sure you won't be hiring them you should put effort into this since they may have friends and colleagues you'd one day like to deal with, so you want them to have a good impression of your company.  Think about the practical stuff you would want to know as a possible employee, not just high-concept ideas.  Tell them things they may want to know but won't want to ask, like the hours you usually work.</li>
		   <li>Answer their questions.</li>
		   <li>Thank them, and let them know when you'll get back to them and what the next step would be. </li>
		   <li>Get back to them within 48 hours.  It's a question of courtesy to let them know something as soon as possible, even if you haven't made a final decision yet.</li>
