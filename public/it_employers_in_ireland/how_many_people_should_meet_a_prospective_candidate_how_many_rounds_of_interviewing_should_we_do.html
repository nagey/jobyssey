<h1>How many people should meet a prospective candidate?  How many rounds of interviewing should we do?</h1>
<p>Applicants should definitely have a change to meet their prospective manager.  Beyond that, at larger companies they may have a chance to meet with a member of the HR department, which can serve as both an initial screening and a chance for the jobseeker to ask detailed benefit questions.  It's nice for applicants to meet others at the company as well, including potential colleagues, members of other departments they'll be working with closely, or the managing director (especially at smaller companies or for more senior roles).</p>  
<p>Whoever you decide to schedule candidates to meet, try to do it all in one day, back-to-back.  This is a thoughtful gesture for your candidates and saves them having to wrangle multiple half days off, but it will also let your own team discuss their thoughts on the applicant while meeting him or her is fresh in everyone's mind.  </p>
<p>As far as rounds of interviewing, 1 phone interview with the hiring manager plus one round of in person interviews is sufficient for most jobs.  Occasionally there are roles that require more than one round, such as a very senior role, or two finalists for the job with no clear preference.  Generally, though, you'll have a good sense of the candidate after the first meeting.</p>
