		<h1>What makes for a great job posting that draws out passive candidates?</h1>
		<p>The best ads are:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Short-</b> Candidate will almost always skip straight to your bullet points, then scroll back up to read the first 3-4 sentences of the job description.  Be sure you say whatever you need to in that space or applicants may miss key information.  Keep in mind that most will click over to your company profile to get more general information (although you should re-iterate anything that is essential to know). </li>
		<li><b>Focused- </b>Stick to talking about the things applicants want to know about this particular job (main duties, skills required, type of work they'll be doing).  Leave out extensive company information that's in your profile, long lists of every possible task they'll ever do, etc.</li>
		<li><b>Unique- </b>Highlight what makes this job different from every other job out there with the same title, and what makes your company different from others in the same business.</li>
		<li><b>Honest- </b>Be upbeat and positive about what the job and company are really about.  There's no need to pretend to be something else- the right candidates are the ones who are excited about joining the company in its' current stage of development.  Likewise, don't gloss over any less-appealing parts to the job- every role has its' less fun aspects, and candidates will keep trying to find the potential downside of a new job until these are identified.</li>
		<li><b>Specific- </b>Be explicit about what you require and what the work is about.  Applicants like to know what a typical project, product or client is like, and brief examples are better than generalizations ("develop wireframes and conduct usability testing for medium to large e-commerce site redesigns" is better than "UI work").</li>
		<li><b>Realistic- </b>Be honest about what is truly a must vs. a plus in your skills requirements, and be sure that the declared salary range fits.  It's tempting to use a huge list of skills to only attract the best talent, but often people who fit 100% of the list won't apply because the salary and responsibilities aren't suitable, those who fit most of the list (the ones you really wanted to see) won't apply because they feel underqualified, and those who only match a few skills will apply anyway because they'll realize that the requirements list exceeds the salary (and conclude that the requirements are more like guidelines).</li>
		</ul>
