<h1>What should I do between offer acceptance and their start?</h1>
		<p>In addition to sending out a contract and making any other official arrangements with your new hire, it's good to start building a relationship right away.  Keep in mind that excellent candidates will continue to receive headhunting calls while they are serving their notice, so it's key to stay in touch. Early on, their new manager should call to offer his or her congratulations, and set up a time for them to drop by and meet the rest of the team.  If they have a notice period of more than one month, it is good to touch base every few weeks to make sure everything is on track.</p>
