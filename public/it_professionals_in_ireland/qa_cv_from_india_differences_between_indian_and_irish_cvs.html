		<h1>QA CV from India- differences between Indian and Irish CVs</h1>

		<p>If this candidate were seeking a job in Ireland, it would be tough to get a foot in the door with this CV because:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Lots of cruft up front</b>- (and by cruft, I mean things targeted more at search engines than humans).  The CV starts with an objective, which is fine, but then runs through professional summary, employment summary, educational profile, and technical skills.  In this case, these are so keyword-heavy they seem to be mainly for SEO.  For Ireland, it's important to get to the information readers want right away, all of this should go at the end of the CV, if its there at all (if a particular certificate or degree is required it can stay at the top, but it doesn't appear to be here).</li>
			<li><b>Employer details lost amid other random stuff, not with work experience</b>- This is a huge formatting difference between CVs in India and CVs in Ireland.  In Ireland, the employer you worked for is most important, not the specific clients you dealt with.  In fact, not making your employer easy to find can seem evasive or even dishonest to Irish readers.</li> 
			<li><b>Work organized into projects</b>- Work should be organized by employer.  If you were truly on completely different projects, it can be broken up by project, but if similar skills were involved combine them.  </li>
			<li><b>Too much project/product information, not enough responsibilities</b>-  A sentence or two to explain the company or product you were working on is sufficient.  Most of the details should be about specific things you were doing.</li>
			<li><b>Too many paragraphs</b>-  Keep the reading text to a minimum and bullet whenever possible</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If this CV were destined for Ireland, here is how I would reformat it:</p>
